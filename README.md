# Memory Game – Flipping Tiles

A straightforward Memory Game where you flip tiles to find matching pairs.  

## Abstract
• Java-based mind game implemented with Swing.  
• An even number of tiles is laid out in a grid. Each color/number/label appears on two tiles.  
• Flip two tiles at a time. If they match, they stay revealed; if not, they reset.  
• This game is designed to exercise and improve memory.

## Technologies Required
• Java 8 or higher  
• Java Swing: for GUI components  
• Java OOP concepts  
• ArrayList: to store tile values and shuffle them for random placement

## Instructions
1. Compile and run the code:  
   ```bash
   javac com/example/memorygame/MemoryGame.java
   java com.example.memorygame.MemoryGame
   ```
2. A 4×4 grid with 16 tiles appears. Click on two tiles to flip them:
   - If they match, they remain turned over.  
   - If not, they flip back after a short delay.  
3. Keep matching until all tiles are revealed.

Enjoy testing your memory!
